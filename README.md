# Theta

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/FTSRG/theta.svg?token=dduaCwDzExdmU27AvBiK&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/FTSRG/theta)

_Theta_ is a generic, modular and configurable model checking framework developed at the [Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group](http://inf.mit.bme.hu/en) of [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](http://www.bme.hu/?language=en), aiming to support the design and evaluation of abstraction refinement-based algorithms for the reachability analysis of various formalisms.
The main distinguishing characteristic of Theta is its architecture that allows the definition of input formalisms with higher level language front-ends, and the combination of various abstract domains, interpreters, and strategies for abstraction and refinement.
